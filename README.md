# Lets-Paint-CG-Package
Let's Paint is a Graphical Editor for user to draw geometrical figures like circle, ellipse, line, spiral using 2D drawing tools. Built with C programming language.

# Algorithms implemented -
######1	Bresenham’s Circle Algorithm to draw a circle
2	Algorithm to rotate a line around a circle
3	Algorithm to draw spiral
4	Algorithm for obtaining coordinates of 2D rectangle after translation, scaling and rotation
5	Hermite Curve algorithm to draw a Hermite curve   
6	Algorithm for Line clipping
7	Algorithm to rotate a wheel
8	Bresenham’s Line Algorithm to draw a line
9	Bresenham’s Ellipse Algorithm to draw an ellipse
10	Algorithm to draw a ship, segment by segment
11	Algorithm for obtaining coordinates of a 3D point after rotation, scaling and translation
12	Bezier Curve algorithm to draw a Bezier curve
13	Algorithm for drawing a polygon and filling it using scan line algorithm

# Steps to run the project -
1. Build C project and run it
2. When the project window opens, select geometric shape of your choice and draw in the workspace
